# Angular Universal basic

Use this repo with to build and customize a new static [Angular Universal](https://angular.io/guide/universal) application with [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To use server-side rendering on your local system with Universal, run `npm run dev:ssr` instead and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Similarly to the `ng serve` command, the application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

To build the project with server-side rendering with Universal, run `npm run build:ssr` instead.

## Prerendering

To prerender your application's pages, run `npm run prerender`. The prerendered files will be stored in the `dist/angular-universal-basic/browser` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
